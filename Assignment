What roles do Dart and Flutter play in mobile app development? How do they complement each other in creating cross-platform applications?
Roles of Dart and Flutter in Mobile App Development
Dart:
•	Programming Language: Dart is the language used to write code in Flutter applications. It is developed by Google and designed for high performance and ease of use in modern app development.
•	Features:
o	Performance: Dart compiles to native code for high performance on mobile devices.
o	Concurrency: Supports asynchronous programming with async and await for efficient handling of tasks like network requests.
o	Rich Libraries: Provides extensive libraries and tools to facilitate development, such as for HTTP requests, file I/O, and more.

Flutter:
•	UI Toolkit: Flutter is a comprehensive framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It is developed by Google.
•	Features:
o	Widgets: Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed and customizable widgets for building user interfaces. These widgets are optimized for smooth animations and transitions.
o	Hot Reload: Allows developers to see changes in real-time without restarting the app, speeding up the development process.
o	Single Codebase: Enables developers to write one codebase that works across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web, and desktop).
How Dart and Flutter Complement Each Other
Integration:
•	Language and Framework: Dart is the language used to write Flutter applications. Flutter's rich set of widgets and tools are designed to work seamlessly with Dart, leveraging its features to create highly performant and responsive UIs.
•	Hot Reload: Dart's language features and Flutter's hot reload capability work together to streamline the development process, allowing for rapid iterations and testing.
•	Performance: Dart's ability to compile to native code complements Flutter’s framework, ensuring that apps run efficiently across different platforms.
Cross-Platform Development:
